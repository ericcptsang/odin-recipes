    <p>If you are looking for a decadent and rich dessert for two that comes together in just minutes, this is it.</p>
    <p>This is a banana foster recipe!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest (from 1 orange), divided, plus additional zest for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups pecan halves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (2 ounces) dark rum (such as Kirk and Sweeny)</li>
        <li>2 large (6 to 7 ounces each) medium-ripe bananas, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 (1/2-cup) scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>Pinch of flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375â„‰. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, and lightly spray with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place egg white, salt, 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of the orange zest, and 1/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium bowl; whisk to combine well. Add pecan halves, stirring to evenly coat pecans in egg white mixture. Scoop pecans from bowl, allowing excess egg white mixture to drip off; spread in an even layer on parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until pecans are lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes, stirring halfway through baking time. Set aside, and let cool, about 20 minutes. (Pecans will not be completely crisp but will continue to crisp as they cool.)</li>
        <li>While pecans cool, place butter, vanilla bean paste, and remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons orange zest, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high; whisk constantly until butter is melted and fully incorporated into sugar and mixture is smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; add rum, and whisk until alcohol evaporates, about 1 minute. Place skillet over medium-high heat; add bananas, cut sides down, and cook until slightly softened and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Gently turn bananas, and cook 30 seconds; remove skillet from heat.</li>
        <li>Place scoops of ice cream directly into skillet; top with 1/2 cup crispy pecans and flaky sea salt. Garnish with additional orange zest (if using); serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
